D-Lab is a program that fosters the development of appropriate technologies and sustainable solutions within the framework of international development. D-Lab’s mission is to improve the quality of life of low-income households through the creation and implementation of low cost technologies. D-Lab’s portfolio of technologies also serves as an educational vehicle that allows students to gain an optimistic and practical understanding of their roles in alleviating poverty.

There are currently nine different academic offerings that make up the suite of D-Lab classes, falling into the broad categories of Development, Design and Dissemination. Several of these classes, including [EC.701 D-Lab I: Development](/courses/ec-701j-d-lab-i-development-fall-2009), [EC.720J D-Lab II: Design](/courses/ec-720j-d-lab-ii-design-spring-2010), and [EC.715 D-Lab: Disseminating Innovations for the Common Good](/courses/ec-715-d-lab-disseminating-innovations-for-the-common-good-spring-2007), have been published in [MIT OpenCourseWare](/).

This is the MIT mechanical engineering department's introduction to mechanical design. The lecture notes are the best compilation of design principles I have ever seen. Students build robots for a class project (where do you think I got the idea for our class?). You can find some really ingenious technical solutions in some of the robots.

At the U.S. Patent office, you can search for any patent issued from the 1700's till now. Looking through patents generates good ideas, and prevents you from reinventing the wheel. If you are thinking of designing a protective carrying case for your banana, sorry, it already exists: U.S. Patent number 6918231.
